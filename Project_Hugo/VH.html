                <p>Victor-Marie Hugo (26 February 1802 – 22 May 1885), was a French Romantic writer and politician. During a literary career that spanned more than sixty years, he wrote in a variety of genres and forms. He is considered to be one of the greatest writers of all time. <br>
                His most famous works are the novels <i>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame </i> (1831) and <i>Les Misérables</i> (1862). In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as <i>Les Contemplations</i> (<i>The Contemplations</i>) and <i>La Légende des siècles</i> (<i>The Legend of the Ages</i>). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play <i>Cromwell </i> and drama <i>Hernani</i>. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the opera <i>Rigoletto</i> and the musicals <i>Les Misérables</i> and <i>Notre-Dame de Paris</i>. <br> He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment or slavery.
                Although he was a committed royalist when young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism, and his literary stature, established him as a national hero. Hugo died on 22 May 1885, aged 83. He was given a state funeral in the Panthéon of Paris, which was attended by over 2 million people, the largest in French history.</p>

        <h2 id="music">Victor Hugo and Music</h2>
        <p>Although Hugo's many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck, Mozart, Weber and Meyerbeer. <br> In <i>Les Misérables</i>, he calls the huntsman's chorus in Weber's Euryanthe, "perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed". He also greatly admired Beethoven and, rather unusually for his time, appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi.
            Two famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo's home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that, thanks to Liszt's piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano – with only one finger. He worked with composer Louise Bertin, writing the libretto for her 1836 opera <i>La Esmeralda</i>, which was based on the character in <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>. He was also on friendly terms with Frederic Chopin. He introduced him to George Sand who would be his lover for years. In 1849, Hugo attended Chopins funeral.
            <br>Well over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo's works from the 19th century until the present day. In particular, Hugo's plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo's works and among them are Donizetti's <i>Lucrezia Borgia </i>(1833), Verdi's <i>Rigoletto</i> (1851) and <i>Ernani</i> (1844), and Ponchielli's <i>La Gioconda</i> (1876).
            Hugo's novels, as well as his plays, have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as <i>Notre-Dame de Paris</i> and the ever-popular <i>Les Misérables</i>, London West End's longest running musical. Additionally, Hugo's poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, Franck, Lalo, Liszt, Massenet, Saint-Saëns, Rachmaninoff, and Wagner.</p>
